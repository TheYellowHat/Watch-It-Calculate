# Watch-It-Calculate
Open source code of the WatchFace 'Watch it Calculate' for the pebble smartwatch. Check it out here or on the pebble appstore.

It's open source so don't worry about it.
There is documentation in the code itself.
The logic for the calculating feature maybe a bit hard to swallow.
As far as the rest of the code is concerned, a chunk of it is from the pebble watchface tutorial.
So if you have any trouble understanding the logic, check out the watchface tutorial.
